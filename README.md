# Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) function for mediation effects

Revised Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) function for the computation of mediation effects (Monte Carlo Method for Assessing Mediation; MCMAM).

This function is based on Preacher and Selig 2008 [app]((https://www.quantpsy.org/medmc/medmc.htm)), with some modification, such as (a) put standard errors, without needing to square it, (b) setting seed, (c) Include the number and the "D" from the TECH3 Mplus output, in case of multilevel mediation
